- Parallelize computations on individual people
- Generate reports based on files (new, in addition to people reports)
- save CSV to actual CSV file named after the repo
- consider aggregrate human stats across projects
- sort the CSV just for nicer output
- allow projects to scan to be listed in a config file (JSON)
- output graphs using OSS graph tools
- convert Date Strings into Date objects for better comparisons
- generate more stats on a per person basis
  - list of times between commits 
    - average time and stdev
  - standard deviation of lines added/removed (impact)
- roll up reports on a per project basis
  - report on how powerful is the long tail
  - avg commit size / stdev
  - avg commits month / stdev
  - burnout/superstar indicator (rate of change)
     - what is the acceleration of the rate of time between commits 
     - what is the acceleration of the size of commits 
- use aggregrate project data to produce comparisons
  - X/Y graph of various projects -- commit volume vs count
  - (OR:  things like #avg commit volume vs # contributors)
