Look At Git
===========

This project intends to scan and compare statistics in various git 
repositories to determine commit patterns and other information 
related to development and community contribution levels.  

In this vein, it is similar to ohloh, but aims to collect 
deeper statistics, run more frequently, and be 100% 
open source.  It is not there yet.  Where possible, 
lookatgit will leverage OSS statistics tools/libraries.

See also: http://github.com/mpdehaan/ekg/tree/master for EKG,
a mailing list scanner.  Adventurous folks may one day
cross the streams.

Non-git repositories can be scanned by converting them to git.

See also LICENSE and COPYING files for further info.

Usage:

install scala (from upstream) and openjdk
edit Makefile to taste
run "make compile test"
